# --Information-Retrieval-System-
The program takes input from the user, checks the given dataset of documents, and retrieves the relevant paragraph/passage in which the query is contained. 

Steps to run the program:
1. Open the main.py file in any code editor.
2. Run main.py. The code will call UI.py, which opens the GUI window to take a query from the user.
3. This window also shows the previous three queries searched
4. Enter the query you want to search and click on the search button.
5. Close this GUI Window by clicking the cross button on the top right.
5. The main.py program will process the query and retrieve the data.
6. The retrieved data is printed to searchResultPhraseQuery.txt, which stores the result in the query as a phase query, and searchResultBoolean.txt files, which stores all the paragraphs containing those words.
7. Open the file from the execution folder to see the results.
